# OSS - Development in the Open

## Benjamin Lannon | August 6, 2019 | Careers in Code

---

# First off: What is Open Source?

Develop software where the code is public and free to obtain, modify, and even redistribute.

Examples include VS Code, NodeJS, Blender, Firefox

---

# Some example OSS projects

- Syracuse.io: source for https://syracuse.io meetups site
- Gatsby: Performance focused React Static Site Generator

---

# Where do you find the code / community

- Google their official site and look for a "Community" section
- Git Hosting: GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket
- Community Forums / chatrooms: Gitter, Discord, Slack

---

# Getting into it: The Code

- "Good First Issue" or "Help Wanted": Issues looking for new contributors. Usually very willing to help guide you to solve the issue.
- Writing tests for codebases can bring a layer of security that the code does what it is meant to do.

Don't feel afraid to submit issues or feature requests. The worst thing that could happen is they say it is out of scope, and then you could build that feature yourself.

---

# Getting into it: Everything else

- Documentation
- Accessibility (A11y) improvements
- Marketing / Design
- Promoting on social media

---

# Learning more about the insights around a tool

- Podcasts
- YouTube / Twitch Streams
- Blogposts (Dev.to)
- Contact the devs directly

---

# Key Insights I've found through OSS. 

- Look for something you care about
- Have good communication
- Have patience
- Don't be afraid to ask for help
